🧠 DermalScan: AI Facial Skin Aging Detection App

  DermalScan is an AI-powered web application that detects facial skin aging conditions from images. The system automatically identifies faces, predicts skin conditions such as clear skin, dark spots, puffy eyes, and wrinkles, estimates an approximate age, and visualizes results with confidence scores using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

This project integrates CNN-based deep learning models, face detection, and a responsive web interface to deliver fast and accurate predictions suitable for real-world usage.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Multi-face detection from a single image

✅ AI-based skin condition classification

✅ Confidence percentage for each prediction

✅ Approximate age estimation based on skin condition

✅ Annotated image with bounding boxes and labels

✅ Download annotated image

✅ Export predictions as CSV file

✅ Responsive web UI (HTML + CSS + Flask)

✅ End-to-end inference pipeline

✅ Processing time ≤ 5 seconds per image

🧠 Skin Conditions Detected

  --> Clear Skin

  --> Dark Spots

  --> Puffy Eyes

  --> Wrinkles

🏗️ System Architecture (High Level)

  --> User uploads an image through the web interface

  --> Backend detects faces using OpenCV DNN face detector

  --> Each detected face is cropped and preprocessed

  --> Trained CNN model (EfficientNetB0) predicts skin condition

  --> Confidence score and age are generated

  --> Results are visualized and made downloadable

🧪 Model Details

The skin condition classifier was trained using a public facial skin dataset with four classes.

📊 Model Performance Comparison
Model	              Training Accuracy	        Validation Accuracy
EfficientNetB0	         90.36%	                   95.63%
MobileNetV2	             94.69%	                   87.92%

✔ Final model used: EfficientNetB0
✔ Selected for better generalization and validation performance

📌 The trained model file is not uploaded to GitHub.
Instead, a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the full training process is included.
